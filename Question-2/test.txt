Graham says that Perld is cooler than Java and Python than Perl. 
In some circles, maybe. Graham uses the example of Slashdot, 
written in Perl. But what about Advogato, written in C? What 
about all of the cool P2P stuff being written in all three of the 
languages? Considering that Perl is older than Java, and was at 
one time the Next Big Language, I think you would have a hard 
time getting statistical evidence that programmers consider Perl 
"cooler" than Java, except perhaps by virtue of the fact that 
Java has spent a few years as the "industry standard" (and is 
thus uncool for the same reason that the Spice Girls are uncool) 
and Perl is still "underground" (and thus cool, for the same 
reason that ambient is cool). Python is even more "underground" 
than Perl (and thus cooler?). Maybe all Graham has demonstrated 
is that proximity to Lisp drives a language underground. Except 
that he's got the proximity to Lisp argument backwards too.
